The LyricsFetcher Suite is a set of utilities for grabbing the lyrics 
corresponding to your fave music on the internet.

This tool is designed to run with the Python 2 language. It isn't suitable for use with Python 3.

Python Dependencies
===================

* urllib  
* urllib2
* gpod (the libgpod python bindings, a library for managing iPods on UNIX systems)

Installing
===================
* On Windows, just download the master branch's zip archive and decompress it.
* On UNIX (Linux, Mac, BSD...) you will run git clone git://github.com/hugoatease/LyricsFetcher.git . It allows you to stay in touch with improvements by typing 'git pull origin master'

Updating
==================
* On Windows, please check periodically github.com/hugoatease/LyricsFetcher for new updates
* On UNIX, run 'git pull origin master' oftenly

Using
=============
The package come with these files and folders:
* shell.py allows you to interact with LyricsFetcher script as commands. It can be very useful for running LyricsFetcher on Windows platforms, but it can't print tracebacks (Python error messages).
* metawalker.py scans your music player or path and makes a database called 'meta.db'.
* lyrics.py downloads your lyrics and stores them into 'lyrics.db'.
* txtexport.py exports 'lyrics.db' as .txt files, in an 'export/' folder.
* tagexport.py writes 'lyrics.db' data into the corresponding audio files metadata, using USLT tag in MP3s or 'lyr' tag in AAC files.
* ipodupdate.py updates your iPod's database to show the tag lyrics. For the moment, it's running only on linux and is shipped only with the 'experimental' branch of our git repository
